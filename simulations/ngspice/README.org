Many of the spice simulations in this directory use vendor-distributed
models. I've set up the simulations to look for these models in the
SPICELIB environment variable. In order to run these simulations,
you'll need to track down the models from vendor websites and place
them in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to by SPICELIB.
