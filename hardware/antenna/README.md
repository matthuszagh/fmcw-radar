There are 3 directories here:
1. patch_1x1x5, which is a single 1-feed, 5-element patch array.
2. patch_2x1x5, which is two of patch_1x1x5 side by side, with a conducting surface in-between.
3. patch_8x1x5, which is the same as patch_2x1x5 but with 8 of patch_1x1x5 instead of 2.

The first and second directories are used for simulation only. The last is used as the antenna for
the actual receiver.
