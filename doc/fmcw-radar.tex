\chapter{Attribution \& Intent}
\label{cha:attribution}

This design is adapted from
\href{http://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html}{a blog post by Henrik
  Forst\'en}. A large portion of the design and schematics as well as parts of the description are
his and should be thus credited. I've made a number of modifications to the schematic and attempted
to thoroughly document the radar's operation in an effort to understand it. I hope that the
description below will be useful to others who want to understand how a radar can be built from
scratch but who, like me, are relatively new to electronics design.

\chapter{Physics}
\label{cha:overview}

\section{Range Calculation}
\label{sec:range}

The principle of operation of an FMCW radar is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fmcw-principle}. A sinusoidal
signal that ramps in frequency is transmitted through air via an antenna. The reflected signal is
picked up by another antenna and mixed with the original signal.

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{data/fmcw-principle}
        \caption{FMCW radar operation: a delayed signal is modulated with the original signal and
          the distance to the remote object can be backed out from the phase difference between the
          two signals.}
        \label{fig:fmcw-principle}
\end{figure}

Because the signal travels at the speed of light, the distance to the object can be computed using
Eq.~\ref{eq:distance-generic}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:distance-generic}
        d = \frac{c t_{\text{d}}}{2}
\end{equation}

$c$ is the speed of light, $t_{\text{d}}$ is the time delay and the 2 is necessary because we are
computing the round-trip time. By using the programmed frequency ramp rate we can express this
equation in terms of the frequency difference instead of the time delay\footnote{It's acceptable to
  confine ourselves to a single ramp period for each object since the max distance we can detect
  with a $1 \si{ms}$ ramp period is about $150 \si{km}$, well beyond the radar's other physical
  limits. We'll ignore the edge case where the transmitted and received signals bridge a ramp
  boundary.}. This is shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:distance-freq}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:distance-freq}
        d = \frac{c t_{\text{ramp}} \Delta f}{2 f_{\text{ramp}}}
\end{equation}

Now we just need to figure out the frequency difference between the transmitted and received
signals. The transmitted signal during one ramp is:

\begin{align}
  s_{\text{t}}(t) &= T \sin\left(\omega_{\text{t}}(t) t\right)  && \text{$T$ is the transmitted
                                                                   signal's amplitude.} \\
                  &= T \sin\left(2 \pi f(t) t\right) \\
                  &= T \sin\left(2 \pi t \left( f_0 + t \frac{f_{\text{ramp}}}{t_{\text{ramp}}}
                    \right) \right)
\end{align}

The corresponding received signal is:

\begin{align}
  s_{\text{r}}(t-t_{\text{d}}) &= R \sin \left(\omega_{\text{r}}(t-t_{\text{d}})
                                 (t-t_{\text{d}})\right) \\
                               &= R \sin \left(2 \pi \left(f(t-t_{\text{d}}) +
                                 f_{\text{D}}\right)(t-t_{\text{d}})\right) && \text{$f_{\text{D}}$
                                                                               is the Doppler
                                                                               shift.}
\end{align}

The mixer computes the product of these two signals:

\begin{align}
  m &= s_{\text{t}}(t) s_{\text{r}}(t-t_{\text{d}}) \\
    &\approx T R \cos \left( \omega_{\text{t}}t - \omega_{\text{r}}t + \omega_{\text{r}}t_{\text{d}}
      \right) && \text{\footnotemark} \\
    &\approx T R \cos \left( (\omega_{\text{t}} - \omega_{\text{r}})t + \phi \right)
\end{align}
\footnotetext{We've used the identity
  $\sin\theta\sin\phi = \left[\cos(\theta - \phi) - \cos(\theta + \phi)\right]/2$ and the fact that
  the sum term is well outside the \hyperref[sec:adl5802]{mixer} output IF range (as well as the
  subsequent \hyperref[sec:ada4940-2]{IF amplifier} pass-band) and will therefore be filtered out.}

$\omega_{\text{r}}t_{\text{d}} = \phi$ is a phase term since it is not a function of $t$ and
therefore doesn't affect the frequency. So, we see that the mixer output is a signal whose frequency
is equal to the difference frequency between the transmitted and received signals. We can use the
Fourier transform to determine this frequency while ignoring the irrelevant coefficient terms and
phase shift. The Fourier transform also makes it easy to separate different objects which will each
show up as a separate frequency difference. The one complicating factor is that the received
frequency encodes the Doppler shift in addition to the distance. So, what we actually measure is
$2 \pi (\Delta f - f_{\text{D}})$ instead of $2 \pi \Delta f$. To correct for the Doppler shift we
can take multiple measurements of the object to compute its speed\footnote{The fact that the
  individual distance calculations are inaccurate by the Doppler shift doesn't matter here since the
  speed will be constant on the order of the ADC sampling period and will therefore only produce a
  constant translation that is cancelled out when computing successive displacements.} and then use
the non-relativistic equation for the Doppler shift given by Eq.~\ref{eq:doppler}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:doppler}
        f_{\text{D}} = \frac{v_{\text{r}}}{c} f_0
\end{equation}

$v_{\text{r}}$ is the object's computed speed and $f_0$ is the instantaneous ramp frequency. This
must be added back in to the original result to get the true distance. However, because the speeds
we're dealing with are sufficiently low, the Doppler contribution can be effectively ignored. For
instance, the Doppler shift contribution to the distance measurement caused by a car on the highway
travelling at $70 \si{mi/h}$ is only $14 \si{cm}$. This consideration only really becomes important
when using radar for military applications such as for high-speed aircraft or missile defense.

\section{Radar Equation}
\label{sec:radar-equation}

\fixme{There's a really good description of the radar equation derivation at
  \href{http://www.radartutorial.eu/01.basics/The\%20Radar\%20Range\%20Equation.en.html}{this
    link}. It should be incorporated here to provide an intuitive understanding of this equation.}

The maximum range detectable by a radar is given by the radar equation, Eq.~\ref{eq:radar}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:radar}
        R_{\text{max}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{P_{\text{t}} G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{P_{\text{min}} {(4
              \pi)}^3}}
\end{equation}

\label{tab:radar-equation}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X l}
        \toprule
        Variable & Description & Value \\
        \midrule
        $P_{\text{t}}$ & Transmitted power. & $19.5 \si{dBm}$\footnote{$26 \si{dBm}$ adjusted for
          the 75\% \hyperref[sec:antenna-transmission]{antenna} efficiency.} \\
        $G$ & Antenna gain. & $14 \si{dBi}$ \\
        $\lambda$ & Wavelength. & $5.4 \si{cm}$\footnote{Using the center frequency, $5.6 \si{GHz}$.} \\
        $\sigma$ & Target cross section. & $1 \si{m^2}$ \\
        $P_{\text{min}}$ & Minimum detectable signal power. & $-118 \si{dBm}$\footnote{See
          \cref{sec:min-detectable-power}.} \\
        \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Plugging these values in, we find a maximum range of $357 \si{m}$. Using \cref{sec:range} above,
this corresponds to a maximum difference frequency of $1.4 \si{MHz}$.

In order to find the minimum range that avoids distortion, it's helpful to work backward from the
maximum \hyperref[sec:ltc2292]{ADC} differential input voltage of $2 \si{V}$. The
\hyperref[sec:ada4940-2]{IF amplifier} that feeds this input has a gain of $23 \si{dB}$ and employs
an input filter with a gain of $-10 \si{dBV}$ through most of the passband. Collectively, this
permits a \hyperref[sec:adl5802]{mixer} differential output voltage of up to $0.4 \si{V}$. As
described on Henrik's blog, we can use the equation $V = \sqrt{Z_{\text{load}} P}$ to translate this
into a output power level. Since the mixer's differential output impedance is $200 \si{\Omega}$, the
maximum acceptable output power is $-0.5 \si{dBm}$. It's power conversion gain at $5.5 \si{GHz}$ is
$-3 \si{dB}$ and the collective gain of the \hyperref[sec:sky65404]{LNA} and
\hyperref[sec:trf37a73]{RF amplifier} is $24 \si{dB}$, which sets the maximum input power at
$-21.5 \si{dBm}$. This corresponds to a distance of $1.4 \si{m}$ and difference frequency of
$5.5 \si{kHz}$. This input power is also below the IP1dB of the LNA and RF amplifier system of
$-16.5 \si{dBm}$.

\subsection{Minimum Detectable Power}
\label{sec:min-detectable-power}

In order to determine the minimum detectable power, we must find the noise power and then the SNR
that yields a readily detectable signal. Henrik's blog, as well as
\href{http://www.wireless-nets.com/resources/tutorials/define_SNR_values.html}{this site} recommend
using $20 \si{dB}$ as the minimum SNR\@. To find the noise power, we find the thermal noise and then
multiply it by the bandwidth for one FFT bin (Eq.~\ref{eq:johnson-noise}). We then add the receiver
noise figure.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:johnson-noise}
        P = k_{\text{B}} T B
\end{equation}

$k_{\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature (we use $300 \si{K}$ which is often
used for room temperature) and $B$ is the bandwidth of a single FFT bin in $\si{Hz}$. A single FFT
bin bandwidth is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:fft-bin-bandwidth}.

\begin{align}
        \label{eq:fft-bin-bandwidth}
        B &= \frac{f_{\text{s}}}{N} && \text{$N$ is the number of FFT samples.} \\
        &= \frac{f_{\text{s}}}{f_{\text{s}} t_{\text{ramp}}} && \text{$t_{\text{ramp}}$ is the ramp
                                                                duration, or $1 \si{ms}$.} \\
        &= 1 \si{kHz}
\end{align}

The last step is to determine the receiver noise figure. When two components are connected together,
the equivalent noise factor is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:equiv-noise-factor}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:equiv-noise-factor}
        F_{\text{NET}} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1}
\end{equation}

$F_1$ and $F_2$ are the noise factors of each component and $G_1$ is the gain of component 1. Noise
figure is the decibel equivalent of noise factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:noise-fig}).

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:noise-fig}
        \text{NF} = 10 \log(\text{F})
\end{equation}

Eq.~\ref{eq:equiv-noise-factor} shows why it's important to have an LNA with high gain: it reduces
the noise contributions of later components. The only component whose noise figure is not listed on
its datasheet is the \hyperref[sec:ada4940-2]{IF amplifier}. Henrik uses a guess of
$10 - 20 \si{dB}$, which we will use here as well. TI has
\href{http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt094/slyt094.pdf}{a paper} on this which can be used if a more
precise value is needed. The datasheet also presents information on calculating noise. We use the
same $6 \si{dB}$ value that Henrik uses. \fixme{This really shouldn't just be estimated}.

Putting all these values together gives a minimum detectable power of $-118 \si{dBm}$.

\section{General Layout}

The radar is constructed using a 4-layer board and uses both surfaces of the board. The front layer
contains nearly all of the board's components while the back layer contains a few surface mount
resistors and capacitors. The top layer primarily contains signal traces for top layer SMD
components. In particular, it connects many of the signal traces of the ADC to the FPGA, which is
placed next to it. Note, however, that most of the signal traces extending from the FPGA only start
on the top layer but travel through layer 3. The buck converters and subsequent linear regulators
are placed near the top of the board, not necessarily near the components they drive. In addition to
the large number of signal traces, the top copper layer contains a large ground plane around the
periphery of the board. The 2nd layer is entirely a ground plane. The 3rd layer is largely a ground
plane, although it also contains a significant number of traces extending from the FPGA as well as a
few other components. The 4th layer primarily contains large power planes for each of the different
voltages driving logic in the design. It is worth noting that even though it contains significant
power planes, it still has a ground plane that is the largest copper fill zone in this layer. The
PCB also has 3 large corner mounting vias with smaller vias placed in a circle in the large via's
annular ring. The reason for the small vias is to ensure a continued connection to GND (the mounting
vias are connected to GND) even if a screw thread strips too much copper from the main
via. Additionally, it helps prevent the PCB from being crushed if too much torque is used to tighten
the screw. The 4th corner is occupied by the connections to the DC barrel jack. Power rail traces
are made 0.5mm in width whereas signal traces are 0.2mm in width. Grounded vias are placed liberally
throughout the design. They have a diameter of 0.46mm and a drill hole size of 0.254mm. I've
included several screenshots of the PCB and highlighted important components
(Figures~\ref{fig:fmcw-layer1-layout}, ~\ref{fig:fmcw-layer1-gnd}, ~\ref{fig:fmcw-layer2-gnd},

        \caption{\textbf{Board layout}. The top left of the board is where the power source (barrel
          jack) is connected. The output of the 12V power source is connected to a power plane at
          the top left-middle of the board, that feeds into the buck converters. Large inductors
          connected to the buck converters are placed adjacent to their corresponding buck
          converters. The outputs of the buck converters feed into linear regulators that are mostly
          placed directly below the buck converters. This is also the region where the main crystal
          oscillator is placed and its associated fan-out buffer. Transmission circuitry (the
          frequency synthesizer and some RF amplifiers) are placed at the upper right side of the
          board near the antenna connectors which are placed on the right side of the
          board. Circuitry for signal reception are placed along the right side, adjacent to the
          antenna connectors. The mixer is placed slight inward from here, vertically centered but
          toward the right side of the board. Below this are intermediate frequency op-amps that
          feed the mixed signal into an ADC located just above it and to the left (U8). Located just
          to the left of the IF amplifiers and below the ADC is a flash memory IC (U40) which feeds
          data to the FPGA (U30), located just to the left of the ADC. Connectors below the FPGA (P3
          and P4) can be used to externally monitor the FPGA. In the bottom left of the board is a
          component to convert USB data to UART data to configure the FPGA as well as a micro USB
          connection to connect to a host computer. On the left side of the board between the USB
          connection and barrel jack is a SD card reader that stores data that can be read back out
          the FPGA.}

\section{Component Layout Considerations}

\subsection{Power Input}
\label{sec:power-input-layout}

The barrel jack used has an inner diameter of 2.1mm and an outer diameter of 5.5mm and should output
12V. Since barrel jack dimensions and voltage output vary widely, special attention should be given
to make sure the actual hook up matches these specifications.

The pi filter should be placed as close to the barrel jack connection as possible so as to minimize
crosstalk noise with the rest of the board.

All components should be placed sufficiently close to the TPS5420D buck converter, except for the
trace between the voltage divider and VSNS which should be given a sufficiently wide berth from the
PH trace.

\subsection{LTC2292 ADC}

\begin{itemize}
\item The LTC2292 contains 4 positive voltage supply pins each requiring a 0.1$\mu$F bypass
        capacitor. One capacitor each should be placed directly adjacent to each of the 4 voltage
        supply pins.
\item The device contains 2 input pins for the voltage of the device where the output data is
        sent. These, similarly require a 0.1$\mu$F capacitor each. As before they should be placed
        next to their respective pins, not next to one another.
\item VCMA and VCMB each are connected to a 2.2$\mu$F capacitor to GND\@. They should be placed as
        close to the pins as possible.
\item REFHA and REFLA (and REFHB and REFLB) have a 0.1$\mu$F capacitor connected between them. These
        are the most critical capacitors connected to the ADC\@. They must be placed 1.5mm away at
        most, and preferably closer to the pins.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RX1 / RX2}

\begin{itemize}
\item The 100pF capacitor used to bypass TRF37A73 should be place as close as possible to VCC\@.
\end{itemize}

\section{Board Layout}
\label{sec:board-layout}

There should be a section here on board layout. I.e.\ signal plane, ground plane, power plane,
etc. See High Speed Digital Design for recommendations. Also calculate the capacitance between the
power and ground plane. Btw, this is a great way to further filter noise from the power supplies.

\fixme{I'm not exactly sure where it should go, but there should be a section that documents the use
  of vias, especially for high speed signals. Use page 258 of High Speed Logic to calculate the step
  response, and present the results here. Additionally, mention via best practices such as placing an
  adjacent ground via to any signal via to provide a current return path. Also, the use a multiple
  small vias instead of one large one to minimize inductance. While we're at it, it's probably also
  good to calculate trace inductance for certain important signals. I'm not sure where the equation
  for this is, but it should be in High Speed Design.}

\section{RF Impedance Matching}

Document \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_fence}{via fencing} used. Note the general rule
that spacing between vias should not be more than the RF wavelength divided by 20. I believe the
wavelength is 5cm, but check this and then put this in the documentation. For the impedance line
width I've decided to go with the original design's 14.96mil. I'm a little skeptical of the Mantaro
tool below which seems to not calculate effective impedance. Saturn PCB should be pretty good, and
if you can get OpenEMS to do this that would be the best.

Also document the RF via. Note the parallel ground trace running below it (and the ground plane
above it).

\fixme{I don't think the text below is correct.}.

I'm keeping it for the value of knowing the trace widths used by the original design. However, the
idea that the trace widths are unimportant seems dubious. The PCB calculator built into KiCad should
be used for this. Additionally, it is probably worth looking at the following guides:
\href{https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/5100#}{Maxim: General Layout
  Guidelines for RF and Mixed-Signal PCBs},
\href{https://hackaday.com/2016/03/23/michael-ossmann-makes-you-an-rf-design-hero/}{Hackaday:
  Michael Ossmann makes you an RF design hero},
\href{https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Basic-Linear-Design/Chapter12.pdf}{Analog}. I
would also look at \href{https://github.com/erichVK5/WilkinsonPowerDividerFootprintGenerator}{this
  tool} for creating a Wilkinson power divider. Also, the trace width for $50\si{\Omega}$ resistors
seems to have been more like 15mil.

Use \href{http://www.mantaro.com/resources/impedance-calculator.htm}{this Mantaro impedance
  calculator} to calculate trace widths. The proper width should be 11.98mil.

The right side of the board houses the RF circuitry (i.e. transmitter, receivers and SMA
connectors). The signals are carried to the antennas (a patch-fed horn for transmission and a patch
array for reception) via a $50\si{\Omega}$ coaxial cable. All RF inputs and outputs for components
should match this $50\si{\Omega}$ impedance. The original layout does not seem overly concerned with
the microstrip transmission line width between RF components. They are kept short and generally have
a trace width of about 0.3mm. However, many of them are not even remotely straight and this doesn't
seem to be an issue. Where possible the microstrips should be kept short, straight and with an
unbroken ground plane beneath them. That seems to be all that is necessary for impedance
matching. The patch antennas however will need to be appropriately hooked up in order to match the
$50\si{\Omega}$ impedance. This should be a relatively straightforward calculation. The setup Henrik
uses seems to be the most logical one. He uses a single patch-fed horn antenna for transmission and
a patch array for reception. The horn antenna is made of thin copper. More sophisticated horn
antennas require the ability to weld and probably modeling software (e.g. CST).

\section{Transmission}
\label{sec:antenna-transmission}

I'm using the
\href{https://www.maartenbaert.be/quadcopters/antennas/triple-feed-patch-array-antenna/}{Triple Feed
  Patch Array antenna designed by Maarten Baert} for transmission. Although I'd eventually like to
simulate and design my own antenna, this antenna is cheap, has fairly high gain ($14 \si{dBi}$), has
a radiation efficiency of about 75\% and has almost nonexistent side-lobes. It's also undergone
\href{https://antennatestlab.com/antenna-examples/example-8-triple-feed-patch-array-circularly-polarized-antenna}{testing
  at the Antenna Test Lab}.

\section{Reception}
\label{sec:antenna-reception}

For reception, I'm using the patch array designed by Henrik Forst\'en. Again, I'd like to design and
build my own antenna. However, Henrik's design is cheap and uses the proper spacing to allow
beamforming.
