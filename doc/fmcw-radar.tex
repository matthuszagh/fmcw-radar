\chapter{Attribution \& Intent}
\label{cha:attribution}

This design is adapted from
\href{http://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html}{a blog post by Henrik
  Forst\'en}. A large portion of the design and schematics as well as parts of the description are
his and should be thus credited. I've made a number of modifications to the schematic and attempted
to thoroughly document the radar's operation in an effort to understand it. I hope that the
description below will be useful to others who want to understand how a radar can be built from
scratch but who, like me, are relatively new to electronics design.

\section{Transmission}
\label{sec:antenna-transmission}

I'm using the
\href{https://www.maartenbaert.be/quadcopters/antennas/triple-feed-patch-array-antenna/}{Triple Feed
  Patch Array antenna designed by Maarten Baert} for transmission. Although I'd eventually like to
simulate and design my own antenna, this antenna is cheap, has fairly high gain ($14 \si{dBi}$), has
a radiation efficiency of about 75\% and has almost nonexistent side-lobes. It's also undergone
\href{https://antennatestlab.com/antenna-examples/example-8-triple-feed-patch-array-circularly-polarized-antenna}{testing
  at the Antenna Test Lab}.

\section{Reception}
\label{sec:antenna-reception}

For reception, I'm using the patch array designed by Henrik Forst\'en. Again, I'd like to design and
build my own antenna. However, Henrik's design is cheap and uses the proper spacing to allow
beamforming.
