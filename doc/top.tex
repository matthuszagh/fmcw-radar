\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:top-overview}

The top-level schematic has two purposes: it instantiates the various submodules in the design and
generates a $40 \si{MHz}$ clock signal that is distributed to the
\hyperref[sec:xc7a15t-ftg256]{FPGA}, \hyperref[sec:ltc2292]{ADC} and
\hyperref[sec:adf4158]{frequency synthesizer}.

\subsection{KT2520K 40MHz TXCO}
\label{sec:kt2520k}

The KT2520K crystal oscillator outputs a $40 \si{MHz}$ clipped sine wave. It requires a DC-blocking
capacitor $\geq 1 \si{nF}$ at the output since one is not included internally.

\subsection{NC7S04 Inverter}
\label{sec:nc7s04}

Using a feedback resistor between the inverter's output and input biases the input to
$V_{\text{CC}}/2$, thus keeping the duty cycle near 50\%. The feedback bypass capacitor ensures that
high-frequency feedback signals are filtered and only the average voltage biases the input.

\subsection{NB3N551 1:4 Clock Buffer}
\label{sec:nb3n551}

The clock buffer duplicates the square wave input clock signal into 3 identical clock outputs that
are fed to the FPGA, ADC and frequency synthesizer.
